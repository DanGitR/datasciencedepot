# Getting Started in Data Science

Students studying data science ask lots of questions about how to break into the field from another line of work.

My primary advice to someone starting out in data Science is actually general job seeking advice. Since 75% of jobs are found through people's contact networks (reference: 2015 personal conversation with a consultant at the Lee Harrison Hecht outplacement firm), a beginning data scientist needs to develop a contact network that includes data scientists.

The toughest part of any job search is getting past the keyword-based resume filters employed by many HR departments. Building your network is the best way to get past the automated resume filters.

Second, consider jobs that are related to data science, but called by other names: market research, analytics, web analytics, etc.

Third, don't be afraid to take a job that is "entry level," even if it requires that you take a salary cut relative to your last job. Why? After a year or two of real world experience, you'll be a lot more valuable.

## Question: What are data science career options for an experienced IT professional?

**Answer:** The biggest question is whether one is willing to take an entry level data science job at an entry level salary. Depending on one's current salary and financial flexibility, it may be worthwhile to take an entry level data science job instead of a technical project or engineering manager role.

2 - 3 years of significant work as a data scientist will be more valuable to a person's long term career prospects than taking a job that is related to data science but where a person isn't developing a portfolio of completed data science projects.  

The most important thing a person can do to enhance her/his career prospects is to develop relationships in the field where one wants to work. In the U.S., 75% of jobs are found by networking (per a 2015 conversation I had with a consultant at Lee Harrison Hecht, a career coaching service), so the market places a premium on developing relationships before you make a career move.
